# Climate-Resilience-Web
The primary objective of the project is to create an interactive application that allows users to monitor real-time weather conditions in any city globally. By leveraging overloaded subprograms, this application achieves modular and reusable code components that efficiently retrieve and process weather data.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
